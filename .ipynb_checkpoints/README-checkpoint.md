Executive Orders Effecting Immigration Process Article and Data

In this project, I aimed to report on the new Executive Orders that were from the new Trump Administration after his Inauguration. This helped with my reporting skills with immigration, but also helped me learn more about the data. The data is about the amount of people that can be naturalized within the U.S., the Country that they were born in for some perspective, and a chart of how many cases within immigration were completed that year. The Executive Orders that have been passed that effect immgigration are listed with how they will effect this field. 

For this project, I specifically wanted something to do with politics and a reason to make a map. Maps are made a lot for news articles, but I have not made many and this was an opportunity to do that. I also attempted to make a table that provides a description of where these people are born that are eligible for naturalization, and a bar chart to show how many were approved with a small timeline in the annotations. It allowed me to learn more about the coding and the different aspects that a person needs to think about during this process.

For the data, I had to go through and make a chart that I can use with DataWrapper. I got rid of the specfic cities and used the states as this was easier to read. The data does not list any number under 1,000 because of safety reasons for individuals, so this helped with this problem. I took a PDF and then created another chart to use for the bar chart. For the map, I used the total for each country. 

The descriptions of the Executive Orders can be found on the https://www.whitehouse.gov/ website. Most of the data can be found at the https://www.uscis.gov/ website in their datasets about naturalization. The links are also on the charts within the coding. All the data used is within the .csv file. 

I wanted to make a graphic for the countries of birth table, but thought that it would be easier to understand through a table where people can look for all the countries in an accessible way. If I had more time, I would have liked to make my own picture or visual for the top of the article as it did not quite fit the topic.
